Dear Philadelphia Department of Licenses and Inspections,

I am writing to you once again regarding the dangerous condition of the property adjacent to mine. Bricks and debris are continually falling into my yard, posing a serious risk to my safety and property. Despite my efforts to maintain a safe environment, the situation is deteriorating. I urgently request an update on the status of my previous demolition request and a timeline for when the property will be addressed.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this critical matter.

Sincerely, Carmen Rivas
